### I'm a passionate Java programmer with a deep interest in exploring advanced technologies within the Java ecosystem, including testing frameworks, collections, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Rest, ORM, Hibernate, and Docker. Currently, I'm working on expanding my skills in these areas to build robust and efficient applications.

### Outside of programming, I enjoy reading books and I'm a gaming enthusiast. I spend my free time building custom PC setups. Additionally, I share insights and updates on the latest tech trends on vivitech.pl, where I cover topics ranging from hardware releases to software innovations.
